"🌍 The European Union is already taking action to address the threat of quantum computing 🌍\n\nThe digital world is not static, it is constantly evolving! This huge dynamic results in the development of constant technological breakthroughs. Depending on their application, these technologies can offer remarkable benefits or, conversely, cause significant problems.\n\nCurrently used cybersecurity solutions cannot resist quantum attacks, which makes them particularly vulnerable to the upcoming technology. Imagine that bad actors are already downloading your encrypted information today, as they wait for the right quantum technology to decrypt it in the future, and get access to your private data, such as your confidential communications, financial transaction information, or health status.\n\nThis is not just a theoretical danger. In fact, it is such a significant threat that the European Union has promptly responded by introducing a comprehensive agenda for quantum cybersecurity in Europe.\n\nThis plan emphasizes the need for encryption that is both unbreakable and suitable for the post-quantum era, highlighting:\n\n✔ The pressing importance of cybersecurity as a foundational pillar for Europe's economic stability;\n\n✔ The vital need for a cohesive European strategy, in alignment with member states, to ensure a smooth transition to post-quantum security;\n\n✔ The amplification of cooperation between the public and private sectors to robustly tackle this quantum threat.\n\nThis threat is no longer talk of the future, it is already a serious reality that the EU is taking action to protect against.\n\nWhat actions will you take to protect yourself?\n\n✉️ Contact us to find out more ✉️\n\n\n\n#QuantumNova #QNova#quantum #quantumcomputing #quantumsecurity #quantumscience #quantummechanics #cuttingedgetechnology #PostQuantumCryptography #cybersecurity #cryptography #cybercrime","['#QuantumNova', '#QNova', '#quantum', '#quantumcomputing', '#quantumsecurity', '#quantumscience', '#quantummechanics', '#cuttingedgetechnology', '#PostQuantumCryptography', '#cybersecurity', '#cryptography', '#cybercrime']",3,0,0,Image,[],https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7091810639496585216

"If there's one thing cybersecurity experts agree on, it's that the quantum threat of Y2Q is on its way. \n\n🌐 But what is the Y2Q? 🌐 Y2Q means ""Year 2 Quantum"" but can also be referred to as Q-Day. In simple terms, it's the year when quantum computers become powerful enough to break today's encryption standards! It is expected to occur between 2 and 3 years from now. \n\nQuantum computers have nothing to do with the computers we know and use daily. They have the power to perform complex mathematical computations, optimization problems, and data-related tasks at an unprecedented pace, far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers. This results in classical computers being unable to resist attacks by their quantum counterparts. \n\nCryptographic solutions generally used such as RSA, DH, DSA may be enough to safeguard your data but will no longer serve when quantum computers can be accessed by bad actors. \n\nMoreover, current investigations by Harvard Business Review, MIT, and even McKinsey show that sensitive data is already being harvested from companies and institutions to be later decrypted by bad actors using quantum computing. \n\nGovernments and global institutions are now aware of the risks involved and are starting to take proactive steps to foster data security. Nevertheless, it is essential that the corporate players also take their part in creating a safer cybersecurity environment by setting in place an agenda focused on the transition to a post-quantum encryption world and reinforcing their corporate cryptographic agility to face emerging vulnerabilities. \n\nAt QuantumNova, we are focused and committed to helping the World make this transition with solutions that are already available and ready for this huge challenge. \n\nDon't wait for the Y2Q. Take action now! \n\nBe quantum. Be safe. \n\n\n\n#QuantumNova#QNova#quantum#quantumcomputing#quantumsecurity#quantumscience#quantummechanics#cuttingedgetechnology#PostQuantumCryptography#cybersecurity#cryptography#cybercrime","['#QuantumNova', '#QNova', '#quantum', '#quantumcomputing', '#quantumsecurity', '#quantumscience', '#quantummechanics', '#cuttingedgetechnology', '#PostQuantumCryptography', '#cybersecurity', '#cryptography', '#cybercrime']",3,0,0,Document,[],https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090737447440977920
"In a world where cyber-attacks are becoming bigger, more frequent, and spanning across all sectors of the economy, preparation is key.  Cybersecurity should not be taken lightly. As technology and complexity increase, so does the risk of a breach and its impacts, not only in economic terms but also in terms of reputation and credibility.  Therefore, safeguarding your company´s data is a continuous process that requires focus, commitment, knowledge, and investment.  Assuming you are already safe or that the threat is far, it might be the start of a vulnerability problem.  For that reason, we at QuantumNova, start our methodological approach to customers by doing a network audit to check on the cybersecurity safety risks and vulnerabilities of the systems before implementing our solutions.  Whereas knowing your data security status is crucial, reinforcing your cryptographic agility and starting the transition to a post-quantum defensive model is urgent.   At QuantumNova we are specialized in the development of post-quantum cryptographic solutions that not only protect you from current possible cyber threats but create an unbreakable defensive barrier against future quantum attacks.  Book an audit with us and check your cybersecurity status. The future is now!

"Did you know that cyberattacks have dealt a crushing blow to American businesses?According to Comparitech's analysis, ransomware incidents alone have cost American businesses a staggering $20.9 billion between 2018 and 2023. In 2022, the average ransom demand reached a jaw-dropping $4.15 million for affected businesses.Scary numbers, don't you think? And we're still only talking about American companies...Moreover, it's important to realize that no sector of the economy is exempt from cyber threats. A survey conducted by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies revealed that 42% of small- and medium-sized businesses fell victim to cyberattacks in the past year. Shockingly, estimates suggest that 40% of cyberattacks in 2021 targeted these smaller businesses, marking a staggering 150% increase in attacks over the last two years (Harvard Business Review, 2023).These statistics underscore the urgent need for businesses of all sizes to prioritize cybersecurity and take proactive measures to protect themselves from potential threats.Which precautions are you taking to keep your company protected?\n\n#QuantumNova #QNova#quantum #quantumcomputing #quantumsecurity #quantumscience #quantummechanics #cuttingedgetechnology #PostQuantumCryptography #cybersecurity #cryptography #cybercrime","['#QuantumNova', '#QNova', '#quantum', '#quantumcomputing', '#quantumsecurity', '#quantumscience', '#quantummechanics', '#cuttingedgetechnology', '#PostQuantumCryptography', '#cybersecurity', '#cryptography', '#cybercrime']",6,0,0,Image,[],https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7081605902457331713
"The Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G tech are making our world more connected than ever. This is fantastic for business efficiency and everyday convenience. However, with each new connection, the risk of exposure grows. Remember, everything that's connected can be hacked! \n\nCybersecurity isn't just about protecting your own servers but also about understanding the vulnerabilities within your network of providers, partners, and even customers. Recent incidents have shown that a break in the supply chain's security can give hackers VIP access to your data. \n\nCyber threats don't respect boundaries and often sneak in through the most unsuspecting places, even our trusted supply chains. This brings us to the question:\n\n- Who's going to protect us? Securing our interconnected world requires a united front. Governments, businesses, and users need to work together to transform the internet into secure networks, insisting on human authentication and vigilant cyber guardians. \n\nIt's time to become more cyber aware, to understand the digital terrain we tread daily, and to protect our cyber selves. After all, we're all in this together! \n\nLet's make it happen! \n\n(Vartanian, 2023 at HBR).#QuantumNova #QNova#quantum #quantumcomputing #quantumsecurity #quantumscience #quantummechanics #cuttingedgetechnology #PostQuantumCryptography #cybersecurity #cryptography #cybercrime","['#QuantumNova', '#QNova', '#quantum', '#quantumcomputing', '#quantumsecurity', '#quantumscience', '#quantummechanics', '#cuttingedgetechnology', '#PostQuantumCryptography', '#cybersecurity', '#cryptography', '#cybercrime']",11,0,0,Image,[],https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7082332561649147904
